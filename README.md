## `master` branch previews

You can preview the `master` branch deployments on <https://srihash-staging.herokuapp.com/>. The `production` deployment is on <https://www.srihash.org/>.

## Production Releases

The main development branch is the `master` one. When we want to make a production release, we make a PR targetting the `production` branch.

**Please make sure not to use Squash and Merge or Rebase when merging the production PRs, because then the commits will differ.**
